            Additionally, children are invited to come along but please include
            them in your RSVP in the "Who is coming with you" section. The ranch
            has complimentary accommodation for up to 70 guests (BYO blankets,
            pillows &#38; sheets) so you can celebrate late into the night with
            us and wake for a camp-style breakfast in the morning.
